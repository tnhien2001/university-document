Do you think it's important to spend time
outdoors?

Answer:
Yes, i think that it's important to spend time
out doors.
First, it helps people stay healthy.
This is because they can enjoy fresh air and
move their bodies when they go out.
Second, it helps people expand their relationships
When going out, they can meet and make friends
with a lot of people.
When i was small, i was very shy. i stayed at
home all the time and never went out.
So that i felt very lonely. One day, my mother 
signed me up for a swimming class. So I met a 
lot of friends here and i also became healthier.
This made me realize that spending time outdoors
is very important.
